# SOLID Principles in Practice

Welcome to my learning repository focused on mastering the **SOLID principles** of object-oriented design. This repository documents my journey through understanding and applying each of the SOLID principles using practical, real-world-inspired code examples.

## ðŸ§  What Are SOLID Principles?

**SOLID** is an acronym that represents five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

1. **S** â€“ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. **O** â€“ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. **L** â€“ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. **I** â€“ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. **D** â€“ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and are considered foundational for writing clean, scalable object-oriented code.
